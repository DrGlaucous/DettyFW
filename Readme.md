# Detty Firmware
This is firmware intended to run on an ESP32 in order to control a brushless nerf blaster. 

This was originally part of the [G4](https://github.com/DrGlaucous/G4) repository, but was split off as the firmware became more complex. The G4 repo now mainly contains hardware and CAD for the blaster.


## Branch info
This version doesn't use freeRTOS tasks. Everything (including display) is run inline.
